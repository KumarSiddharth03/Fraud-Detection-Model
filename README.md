# 🛡️ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning.  
The objective is to build a robust system that minimizes **false positives** while ensuring accurate detection of fraud cases.

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, scaling, and encoding  
- Imbalance handling using **SMOTE**  
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- Threshold optimization based on **F1-score** for precision-recall balance  
- Evaluation using classification report, confusion matrix, and precision-recall curve
