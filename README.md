🛡️ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.
The goal is to build a system that minimizes false positives while ensuring fraudulent activities are detected with high accuracy.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing (scaling, handling missing values, encoding)

Class imbalance handled using SMOTE

Feature engineering for better model performance

Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Threshold optimization using F1-score for best balance between precision & recall

Performance evaluation with confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, and classification metrics

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation & visualization

📊 Results

Logistic Regression → Baseline model with moderate precision-recall

Random Forest → High accuracy with improved recall

XGBoost → Best balance of precision & recall after threshold tuning

Final model achieved high F1-score and reduced false positives significantly
